In this project I successfully develope a temperature converter using html,css and javascript.
basically i have used html to create layout and to  structured my webpage then  i used css to style the webpage by adding colour ,alignment of box,font,inputs etc.
furthur I used javascript to compute logic of temperature conversion and thus make my webpage interactive.Temperature can be converted among kelvin,celsius and fahrenite.I have successfully completed the project.
